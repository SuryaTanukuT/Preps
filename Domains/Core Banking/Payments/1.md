ayments — What you must know

👉 This is money moving between people or banks.

Interviewer may ask:
“Explain what happens when you swipe card / use UPI”

You should explain flow like story:

Customer initiates payment

Merchant sends request

Bank checks balance or credit

Payment approved or rejected

Money settlement happens later

You must clearly know:

✔ Authorization vs Settlement
✔ Why payments sometimes show "pending"
✔ Why payment systems need retries
✔ Why duplicate payment protection is important

👉 Layman explanation:

Authorization = checking if you can spend
Settlement = actually moving money between banks
