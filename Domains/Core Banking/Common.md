✅ ACID Transactions

Ensures money safety in database.

✅ Idempotency

Prevents duplicate transactions.

✅ Event Driven Systems

Banks process millions of transactions using event queues.

✅ High Availability

Bank cannot go down.

Even 1 minute downtime = crores loss.

✅ Reconciliation

Matching records between systems.

Banks constantly verify data consistency.

1. Transactions Must Be Atomic

Layman:

Either money fully transfers OR nothing happens.

Never half success.

2. Systems Must Avoid Duplicate Payments

Example:

Customer clicks Pay twice.

System must detect and avoid double debit.

3. Systems Must Recover from Failure

If network crashes during transfer:

✔ Payment should retry safely
✔ Or rollback properly

4. Audit Trail Must Exist

Every money movement must be traceable.

Banks are legally required.
