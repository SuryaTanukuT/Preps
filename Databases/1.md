Here’s a **clear, architect‑level breakdown of SQL vs NoSQL**, specifically tuned for **BFSI systems**, where correctness, auditability, and compliance matter more than raw speed.

This will give you exactly what you need to know to make the right choices.

# **🏦 SQL vs NoSQL — What You Must Know for BFSI**

## **1. SQL (Relational Databases)**  
**Examples:** PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, DB2

### **Why BFSI relies heavily on SQL**
- Strong **ACID guarantees**  
- **Strict schemas** → predictable data  
- **Joins & transactions** → essential for financial logic  
- **Regulatory compliance** (RBI, PCI DSS, SOC2)  
- **Auditability** → every change traceable  
- **Complex queries** for reporting & reconciliation  

### **Best suited for:**
- Core banking  
- Ledgers  
- Payments  
- Loans  
- KYC  
- Insurance policies  
- Claims  
- Customer master data  

### **Strengths**
- Data integrity  
- Transaction safety  
- Mature tooling  
- Strong consistency  
- Referential integrity  

### **Weaknesses**
- Harder to scale horizontally  
- Rigid schema  
- Expensive for massive write throughput  

---

# **📦 2. NoSQL (Non‑Relational Databases)**  
**Examples:** DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Bigtable, Couchbase

### **Why BFSI uses NoSQL (selectively)**
Not for core financial data — but for **speed, scale, and flexibility**.

### **Best suited for:**
- Metadata  
- Session storage  
- Caches  
- Logs  
- Fraud detection pipelines  
- Real‑time analytics  
- Search indexes  
- Document storage (KYC docs, JSON blobs)  

### **Strengths**
- Horizontal scaling  
- Flexible schema  
- High write throughput  
- Low latency  
- Great for distributed systems  

### **Weaknesses**
- Eventual consistency (not ideal for money)  
- No joins  
- No multi‑row ACID transactions (except some modern NoSQL variants)  
- Harder to enforce strict data rules  

---

# **🏦 BFSI Rule of Thumb**
### **SQL = Money, Identity, Compliance**  
### **NoSQL = Speed, Scale, Metadata**

This single rule will save you from 90% of architectural mistakes.

# **🔐 3. Compliance Considerations**

## **SQL**
- Easier to meet:
  - PCI DSS  
  - RBI/IRDAI  
  - SOC2  
  - ISO 27001  
- Supports:
  - Immutable audit logs  
  - Row-level security  
  - Strong constraints  

## **NoSQL**
- Must be used carefully:
  - No implicit referential integrity  
  - Harder to enforce audit trails  
  - Eventual consistency can break financial correctness  

---

# **⚙️ 4. Performance & Scaling**

## **SQL Scaling**
- Vertical scaling (bigger machine)  
- Read replicas  
- Sharding (complex but possible)  

## **NoSQL Scaling**
- Horizontal scaling by design  
- Partitioning/sharding built-in  
- Ideal for:
  - High TPS  
  - Large datasets  
  - Distributed workloads  

---

# **📊 5. Data Modeling Differences**

## **SQL**
- Normalized tables  
- Foreign keys  
- Joins  
- Strong schema  

## **NoSQL**
- Denormalized documents  
- Embedded objects  
- Partition keys  
- Schema-on-write or schema-less  

---

# **🧠 6. When to Use Both (Hybrid Pattern)**  
Modern BFSI systems often combine SQL + NoSQL:

### **SQL for:**
- Accounts  
- Transactions  
- Ledger  
- Customer master  
- Compliance data  

### **NoSQL for:**
- KYC documents (Blob storage + metadata in NoSQL)  
- Fraud detection (Cassandra/Bigtable)  
- Real-time scoring (Redis/DynamoDB)  
- Event logs (Kafka + NoSQL sink)  
- Search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch)  

This hybrid approach gives:
- Safety + correctness  
- Speed + scale  

---

# **🧩 7. Real BFSI Architecture Example**

### **Core Banking**
- PostgreSQL / Oracle

### **KYC**
- MongoDB for JSON docs  
- S3/Blob Storage for files  

### **Fraud Detection**
- Cassandra / Bigtable  
- Redis for real-time scoring  

### **Event Streaming**
- Kafka  

### **Analytics**
- BigQuery / Redshift / Snowflake  

This is the architecture used by modern fintechs and digital banks.
