Round 1 - (Pure Frontend fundamentals)
👉Explain how JavaScript execution context, async behavior, and event loop work. 
👉Questions on closures, Promises, hoisting, string methods, and array methods. 
👉Find top-k elements in an array and hash map problem (DSA). 
👉Difference between arrow functions vs normal functions. 
👉Promises and async logic questions. 


👉 Build a React list with collapse/expand feature
👉 Create a reusable Button component with variants and sizes (like MUI)
👉 React class component lifecycle and hooks behavior
👉 Reconciliation, rendering, and why React behaves a certain way
👉 Reflow vs repaint in the browser and when they happen
👉 CSS animation performance: why transform is preferred
👉 Event propagation: bubbling vs capturing
👉 Write a Promise polyfill with real use cases
👉 Implement an async scheduler with max concurrency
👉 Big list rendering optimization (windowing / virtualization)
👉 Build React-like class components from scratch (ES5)

👉 Design a Pinterest-like grid UI system and discuss architecture and performance - how components break down, how data flows, and how you’d handle large datasets efficiently.
👉 Discuss the HLD of your current or past frontend system or project, covering modules, component hierarchy, API contracts, caching, performance, and how you handle non-functional requirements like response time and availability.

1️⃣ Call, Apply, Bind → Difference + Polyfill implementation
2️⃣ Flatten an Array without Array.flat()
👉 Input: [1,2,3,[4,5,6,[7,8,[10,11]]],9]
👉 Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,9]
3️⃣ Inline 5 divs in a row without flex/margin/padding (Hint: display: inline-block)
4️⃣ Find sum of numbers without a for loop (Hint: reduce() / recursion)
5️⃣ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy — behavior & how to achieve it
6️⃣ Promise & Async/Await output puzzle
7️⃣ Find first repeating character (e.g., "success" → "c")
8️⃣ Stopwatch Implementation (Start, Stop, Reset + live timer)
9️⃣ Build a To-Do List (Vanilla JS/React) → optimize re-renders
🔟 Currying for Infinite Sum
👉 sum(10)(20)(30)() → 60
👉 sum(10)(20)(30)(40)(50)(60)() → 210
