# **🚀 Beginner → Advanced Next.js Curriculum (2024–2025 Ready)**

Next.js has evolved massively, so this curriculum focuses on the **App Router**, **Server Components**, **Server Actions**, and **full‑stack capabilities**.

---

# **1. 🌱 Beginner Level — Foundations**

## **1.1 Prerequisites**
Before touching Next.js, you must know:
- JavaScript fundamentals  
- Modern React (hooks, components, props, state)  
- Basic TypeScript  
- Basic HTML/CSS  

---

## **1.2 Introduction to Next.js**
- What is Next.js  
- Why Next.js vs React  
- File‑based routing  
- Pages vs App Router (App Router is the future)  
- Project structure  

---

## **1.3 App Router Basics**
Learn the new folder‑based routing:
- `app/` directory  
- `page.tsx`  
- `layout.tsx`  
- `loading.tsx`  
- `error.tsx`  
- `not-found.tsx`  

---

## **1.4 Server Components vs Client Components**
This is the **core of modern Next.js**.

Understand:
- What is a Server Component  
- What is a Client Component  
- When to use `"use client"`  
- Performance benefits  

---

## **1.5 Basic Rendering**
- Static rendering  
- Dynamic rendering
