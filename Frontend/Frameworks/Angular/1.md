# **Angular Basic Fundamental Concepts (Before Angular 17)**

## **1. TypeScript Basics**
Angular is built on TypeScript, so you must understand:
- Interfaces  
- Classes  
- Access modifiers  
- Generics  
- Decorators  
- Modules & imports  

Without TS fundamentals, Angular feels confusing.

---

## **2. Angular Architecture**
Understand the building blocks:
- **Modules** (NgModule)  
- **Components**  
- **Templates**  
- **Services**  
- **Dependency Injection**  
- **Pipes**  
- **Directives**  

This is the mental model of Angular.

---

## **3. Components**
The heart of Angular.

Know:
- Component decorator  
- Template & styles  
- Lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, etc.)  
- Input & Output bindings  
- Change detection basics  

---

## **4. Templates & Data Binding**
Angular has **four** types of binding:
- **Interpolation** → `{{ value }}`
- **Property binding** → `[property]="value"`
- **Event binding** → `(click)="handler()"`
- **Two-way binding** → `[(ngModel)]="value"`

Also learn:
- Structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)  
- Attribute directives (`[ngClass]`, `[ngStyle]`)  

---

## **5. Dependency Injection (DI)**
Angular’s DI system is powerful.

Understand:
- Providers  
- Injectable services  
- Hierarchical injectors  
- Singleton vs scoped services  

---

## **6. Services**
Used for:
- Business logic  
- API calls  
- Shared state  
- Utility functions  

Learn how to create and inject services properly.

---

## **7. Angular Modules (NgModule)**
Before standalone components (Angular 14+), modules were mandatory.

You should still know:
- Root module (`AppModule`)  
- Feature modules  
- Shared modules  
- Lazy-loaded modules  

Even in Angular 17, this knowledge helps you understand legacy codebases.

---

## **8. Routing Fundamentals**
Before touching Angular 17’s new router features, learn:
- RouterModule  
- Route definitions  
- RouterLink  
- Route parameters  
- Child routes  
- Guards (AuthGuard, CanActivate, etc.)  

---

## **9. Forms**
Angular has two form systems:

### **Template-driven forms**
- Simple  
- Uses `ngModel`  
- Good for small forms  

### **Reactive forms**
- FormControl  
- FormGroup  
- FormBuilder  
- Validators  
- Best for complex forms  

Reactive forms are essential for Angular 17.

---

## **10. HTTP Client**
Learn:
- HttpClientModule  
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  
- Interceptors  
- Error handling  
- Observables with HttpClient  

---

## **11. Observables & RxJS**
Angular relies heavily on RxJS.

Understand:
- Observable  
- Observer  
- Subscription  
- Operators (map, filter, switchMap, debounceTime)  
- Subjects & BehaviorSubjects  

This is crucial for routing, forms, and HTTP.

---

## **12. Change Detection**
Basics:
- Zone.js  
- Change detection cycle  
- OnPush strategy  
- Async pipe  

Angular 17 optimizations make more sense once you know this.

---

## **13. Pipes**
Built-in pipes:
- `date`  
- `currency`  
- `json`  
- `async`  

Also learn how to create custom pipes.

---

## **14. Build & Project Structure**
Understand:
- Angular CLI  
- Project folder structure  
- Environments  
- Assets  
- Angular.json  

---

# **After mastering these → Move to Angular 17 features**
Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals, Angular 17 becomes easy.

Angular 17 introduces:
- Standalone components  
- Signals  
- New control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`)  
- New router  
- Better SSR  
- Faster builds  

But these make sense only after the basics.
